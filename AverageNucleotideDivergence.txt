#
# Usage            : Run it with bedops and awk commands (step 1)
#					 I recommand R for steps 2 and 3 (using SNPRelate package (Shen et al. 2012) to convert the vcf file into a genotype table but it needs a recoding step in order to have HOMalt as 2 and HOMref as 0)

#         
# Required files   : a .bed file with the list of positions genotyped per individual
#					 a .bed file with a list of filtered positions (see GenomicHeterozygosity.txt for all the details about these sites and how to obtain them)	
#                    a genotype table (e.g. 102samples, Ancient or Neutral dataset in our project)

This code is made for each pair of individuals x and y.

1) We computed the number of sites without any missing data for the two individuals.
To do so, we intersected their .bed files listing their genotyped positions and calculating its length: 
	echo "$(bedops -i x.bed y.bed | awk '{SUM += $3-$2} END {print SUM}')" > NbSitesxy
	
When focusing on neutral sites only, we intersected the .bed files with a list of filtered positions (in regions with recombination rate > 1 cM/Mb, having the same reference allele for both the chimpanzee and gorilla reference genomes, out of CpG islands, not CpG sites if polymorphic within samples).
1/3 of these sites are expected to be unaffected by gene-biased conversion, i.e. neutral according to Pouyet et al. 2018.
We therefore used this command:
	echo "$(bedops -i x.bed y.bed Filtered.bed | awk '{SUM += $3-$2} END {print SUM/3}')" > NbSitesxy


2) We computed the amount of nucleotide difference between their genotypes (Geno_x and Geno_y) with the formula:
	dxy=Geno_x/2+Geno_y/2-2*(Geno_x/2)*(Geno_y/2)
The genotypes were taken from: 
- the 102samples dataset when considering whole-genome sites,
- the Neutral dataset when focusing on neutral sites,
- the Ancient dataset if x and y are both ancient individuals and considering whole-genome sites. 
Note that monomorphic sites are excluded from these data sets but they do not influence the amount of differences between genotypes being found monomorphic within all 102 samples (or 25 ancient samples respectively), i.e. bringing 0 difference


3) We computed the average nucleotide divergence as:
	ùúãxy = Sum(dxy)/NbSitesxy


The values are shown in Supp. Table 2 and used in the MDS plots in Fig. 2A (neutral sites) and S16 (whole-genome).
